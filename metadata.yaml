description: Core infrastructure stack (Traefik, Authelia, Homarr)
long_description: |
  HaLOS core infrastructure providing the foundational web services:

  - Traefik: Reverse proxy and load balancer for all HaLOS web traffic
  - Authelia: Single Sign-On (SSO) identity provider with OIDC support
  - Homarr: Dashboard landing page for accessing all installed applications

  These services are tightly integrated and managed as a single unit.
  Traefik handles HTTPS termination and routing, Authelia provides
  authentication, and Homarr serves as the main user interface.
